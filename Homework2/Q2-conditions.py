# Define two variables of type integer and give them values of your choice. 
# Then, write a conditional code:
# If the two variables are equal: prints ‘The variables are equal’
# If variable1 is double than variable2: prints: ‘The variable1 is double than variable2’
# If variable2 is double than variable1: prints: ‘The variable2 is double than variable1’
# And in any other case: prints the difference between them
