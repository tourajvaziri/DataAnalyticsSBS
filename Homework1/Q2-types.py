# Create different variables that hold different types:
# int, float, str, bool and datetime

# The using the variables perform different operations, for reference on possible operations check: ****
# 1. int: i.e. add, multiplication
# 2. float: i.e. division, finding the floor (3.3 -> 3)
# 3. str: i.e. replace, characters count ('hello' -> 5), to lowercase ('BMW' -> 'bmw')
# 4. bool: i.e. compare two variables (a == b -> True)
# 5. datetime: create a datetime representation of your date of birth.  (Note: For working with datetime you first to need import it)
